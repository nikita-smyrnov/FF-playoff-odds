# FF-playoff-odds
Fantasy football playoff odds calculator (made in Python). Will generate projected wins and playoff odds for each team based on factors like match-ups, average points per game, and the standard deviation of each team.

Uses the external libraries NumPy, pandas, and SciPy.

NOTE: This was hastily written and still a work-in-progress, so repeated/redundant code may be seen along with poor coding style. Also note that modifications to the code and data file will need to be made for your respective league (the test .csv should serve as a useful reference).

TO-DO: 
- Generate odds of winning division (first-round bye)
- Generate odds of making it to championship (as well as odds of winning it)
